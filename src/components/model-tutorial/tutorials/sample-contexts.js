        "title": "Electric Car Battery Waste",
        "text": "BATTERIES ARE STARTING TO PILE UP INTO A PROBLEM. Electrifying transportation is one of the biggest keys to solving the looming climate crisis. With more electric vehicles on the road and fewer gas-guzzlers, drivers burn less fossil fuels and put out fewer planet-heating gases into the atmosphere. But as electric vehicles become more popular, theyre posing another environmental challenge: what to do with their batteries once theyre off the road. Those batteries are starting to pile up into a problem, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature today. Well inevitably need to recycle many of the batteries, but harvesting useful materials from used lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles remains tedious and risky. Luckily, theres still hope. The authors of the paper say that institutional changes — like designing batteries with recycling in mind and using robots to automate disassembly — could reshape battery recycling. In turn, those improvements could make electric vehicles even greener by using old batteries to supply materials needed to build new ones. More than 1 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2017. The study authors estimate that those cars alone will ultimately result in 250,000 tons of discarded battery packs. If those were to end up in landfills, theyd run the risk of going through a process called thermal runaway, which is basically a chemical reaction in the battery that can cause it to heat up, potentially to the point of burning or exploding. (Its the reason why TSA prohibits spare lithium-ion batteries in checked baggage when you board a plane.) But exploding landfills arent the only reason to avoid dumping old batteries. They can actually stay useful long after being taken out of a vehicle. Much like your cellphone, over time, the battery in an electric car wont be able to hold a charge for as long. So drivers get a new battery or a new car. But the used battery can typically hold and discharge up to 80 percent of the power it did when it was brand-new. And thats led to some clever solutions for what to do with the batteries from the first fleets of electric vehicles to hit the market. This year, Toyota launched an initiative to pair old electric vehicle batteries with solar panels to power 7-Eleven stores in Japan. With money to be made in repurposing those batteries, finding second-use applications has overtaken efforts to recycle.If you make it profitable to do it, people will do it. And at this point, theres no system in place, theres no infrastructure [for recycling electric vehicle batteries] and so it really is not obvious how profitable a business its going to be, says Linda Gaines, a co-author of the new paper and a systems analyst at the Argonne National Laboratory, a research center operated by the University of Chicago and the US Department of Energy.Gaines and her co-authors see an emerging opportunity to meet the demand for new car batteries using materials from the old ones. Lithium batteries for electric vehicles are made with cobalt, a mineral that is mined primarily in Congo. But growing demand for cobalt in the region has led to allegations of child labor and other social and environmental fallouts from mining. So for lead author of the study Gavin Harper, a researcher at the University of Birmingham, it might make more sense in some cases to recycle the batteries and repurpose those valuable materials into new manufacturing rather than reusing the batteries. Is it better to get that cobalt out of the battery and make it into new batteries early on? he says.To be able to recycle batteries to the scale that the growing electric vehicle market demands, the industry will need to solve some key challenges. First of all, todays batteries arent designed for easy disassembly. Batteries arent all made in one standard way, making it difficult to automate taking them apart. A lot of the work needs to be done by hand by people who are skilled enough to avoid hurting themselves in the process. After all, these things can explode. (When they do, they can also create noxious gases.) And the types of sealants and adhesives that are used in batteries are extremely strong, making workers jobs harder.DESIGN FOR RECYCLE Robotic disassembly, the paper explains, could solve the risks posed to humans and could make the process fast enough to handle the future influx of batteries. But robots will need more standardized batteries in order to deliver their full potential. Those design changes could also be a win for manufacturers who are looking for cheaper raw materials. Easier disassembly could lead to extracting purer — and, consequently, more valuable — materials from the batteries that can then be sold and / or used to manufacture new batteries.The idea of design for recycle is something that battery manufacturers should have in their heads, Gaines says. That kind of thinking needs to go into product manufacturing general.  The authors plan to begin trials of the solutions theyve outlined, but assembly lines of robots taking apart batteries are still years down the line, without a deadline yet in sight.",

		"title": "CA Proposition 28",
		"text": "PROPOSED LAW SECTION 1. Findings and Declarations. (a) Studies on educational achievement prove that arts and music education improves student learning. Music education has been shown to improve cognitive development and spatial reasoning, while the dramatic arts improve reading comprehension. Arts and music education has also been shown to improve school attendance and individual student self-confidence and motivation to learn, particularly among poor and other at-risk students. An arts education also provides a viable pathway to a job in California\u2019s creative economy, while developing and expanding culture. (b) Despite the clear value of arts and music education, an independent study of arts education in California found: (1) Ninety percent of elementary schools fail to provide a high-quality course of study across arts disciplines. (2) Ninety-six percent of middle schools fail to provide a high-quality course of study across arts disciplines. (3) Seventy-two percent of high schools fail to provide a high-quality course of study across arts disciplines. (c) The same study found that music education, in particular, has seen a dramatic decline in student enrollment and offered curriculum. Not surprisingly, student access to arts education is worse for high- poverty schools. (d) The cause of the steady decline in arts and music education is directly linked to inadequate and unstable funding of such programs. As one school principal simply and honestly stated: \u201CIn tough times, when you cut back to essentials, the first thing to go are the arts programs.\u201D In fact, over 70 percent of all school principals said that inadequate and unstable funding was a significant barrier to providing arts education to their students. (e) The solution to this problem is clear. We need to provide California public schools with a dedicated annual source of additional funding for arts and music education. This act ensures every student in California\u2019s K\u201312 public schools has access to a high- quality arts education by: (1) Increasing and stabilizing funding for arts and music education so that schools can develop and maintain a high-quality course of study in arts and music\u2014year after year. (2) Holding public officials accountable for using such funds for arts and music education by: (A) Requiring that these funds be primarily spent on certificated arts teachers, classified personnel, and teaching aides. (B) Requiring schools to publish annual reports identifying the specific arts programs provided and the number of students participating in the programs funded. (C) Ensuring that every public school will receive increased funding for arts and music education, and providing even more funding for schools that serve children in low-income communities who lack access to arts and music education. (D) Protecting existing Proposition 98 funding of public schools by requiring the Legislature to use money from the state\u2019s General Fund to supplement Proposition 98. (3) Doing all of this without raising taxes. (f) This measure will provide funds to increase by more than 50 percent the number of arts and music educators in classrooms. (g) Therefore, the people declare that arts education is an educational priority worthy of the state\u2019s commitment to a minimum funding guarantee of an additional 1 percent of the amount funded for public education, and hereby enact \u201CThe Arts and Music in Schools\u2014Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act.\u201D SEC. 2. The Arts and Music in Schools\u2014Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act. SEC. 2.1. Chapter 5.1 (commencing with Section 8820) is added to Part 6 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, to read: Chapter 5.1. the artS and MuSiC in SChOOlS\u2014 Funding guarantee and aCCOuntaBilty aCt 8820. (a) The Arts and Music in Schools\u2014Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act is hereby established for the purpose of providing a minimum source of annual funding K\u201312 public schools, including public charter schools, to supplement arts education programs for pupils attending those schools. Text of Proposed Laws | 105 27 28 28 TEXT OF PROPOSED LAWS PROPOSITION 28 CONTINuED (b) (1) Commencing with the first fiscal year following enactment of this act, and for each fiscal year thereafter, there shall be continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years from the General Fund to the department for the purposes of this chapter, an amount which is equal to 1 percent of the total state and local revenues received by local educational agencies in the preceding fiscal year that are included in the calculation of the minimum funding guarantee established by Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, excluding the appropriation made pursuant to this chapter. (2) The Director of Finance shall calculate and publish an estimate of the amount necessary to fund the amount required to be appropriated by this chapter as part of the annual May Revision of the Governor\u2019s Budget, and shall finalize the calculation and publish the required appropriation amount by January 10 each fiscal year as part of the director\u2019s duties pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 41206.01. (3) Notwithstanding any other law, for purposes of making the computations required by subdivision (b) of Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution: (A) For the first fiscal year following enactment of this chapter, the appropriations made pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed supplementary payments in excess of the minimum amount required for that fiscal year pursuant to Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution and shall not be considered towards fulfilling the requirements of Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constituition for that fiscal year. (B) For subsequent fiscal years, the appropriations made pursuant to this subdivision shall be considered moneys that were allocated to school districts from General Fund proceeds of taxes appropriated pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution. (C) Commencing with the second fiscal year following the enactment of this act, and each fiscal year thereafter, \u201Cthe percentage of General Fund revenues appropriated for school districts and community college districts, respectively, in fiscal year 1986\u201387,\u201D for purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, shall be deemed to be the percentage of General Fund revenues that would have been appropriated for those entities if the share of the General Fund of the supplementary payments calculated pursuant to this subdivision in the prior fiscal year had been included in the percentage of General Fund revenues appropriated for school districts and community college districts, respectively, in fiscal year 1986\u201387. (c) Funds appropriated pursuant to this chapter shall be allocated by the department to each local educational agency as the sum of the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) and the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (2) for each schoolsite in that local educational agency, as follows: (1) An amount equal to the product of 70 percent of the funding appropriated in subdivision (b) times the school\u2019s enrollment in the prior fiscal year, divided by the total statewide enrollment in the prior fiscal year of local educational agencies. (2) An amount equal to the product of 30 percent of the funds appropriated in subdivision (b) times the school\u2019s enrollment of economically disadvantaged pupils in the prior fiscal year, divided by the total statewide enrollment of economically disadvantaged pupils in the prior fiscal year of local educational agencies. For schools serving preschool pupils, the school\u2019s enrollment of economically disadvantaged pupils shall be deemed to equal the preschool\u2019s enrollment times the same percentage of pupils that are economically disadvantaged at the closest elementary schoolsite within the preschool\u2019s local educational agency, if applicable. (d) Local educational agencies shall allocate to each schoolsite an amount equal to the sum of the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) and the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c). (e) For each schoolsite or preschool, the principal or program director shall develop an expenditure plan for the funds allocated pursuant to subdivision (d). (f) Funds allocated pursuant to subdivision (d) shall be available for use for up to three fiscal years after which time the funds shall be reverted to the department, which shall reallocate those funds to all local educational agencies in the following fiscal year pursuant to subdivision (c). (g) As a condition of receipt of funds pursuant to this chapter, a local educational agency shall annually: (1) Certify that all funds are used to provide arts education, and that funds expended in the prior fiscal year were, in fact, used for those purposes, except as provided in paragraph (3). For local educational agencies with an enrollment of 500 or more pupils, the certification shall also ensure that at least 80 percent of funds to be expended will be used to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education instruction and that the remaining funds will be used for training, supplies and materials, and arts educational partnership programs. (2) Certify that such funds received will be used to supplement funding for arts education programs and that funds received in the prior fiscal year were, in fact, used to supplement arts education programs. (3) Certify that no more than 1 percent of funds received will be used for a local educational agency\u2019s administrative expenses to implement this chapter and that funds received in the prior fiscal year were, in fact, used within that limit. (4) Submit an annual board- or body-approved report in a manner determined by the Superintendent, that shall be posted on the local educational agency\u2019s and the department\u2019s internet websites and that details the type of arts education programs funded by the 106 | Text of Proposed Laws TEXT OF PROPOSED LAWS PROPOSITION 28 CONTINuED program, the number of full-time equivalent teachers, classified personnel, and teaching aides, the number of pupils served, and the number of schoolsites providing arts education programs with those funds. (h) The department may, for good cause shown, provide a waiver from the requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) upon written request from the principal of a schoolsite. (i) Annual audits conducted in accordance with Section 41020 shall include all funds received and distributed by the local educational agency pursuant to this section, and shall include a determination of whether the funds were expended pursuant to the certifications submitted and the requirements of this section. (j)The Legislature may reduce the annual appropriation required by this chapter if the Legislature suspends the operation of Proposition 98 by the enactment of an urgency statute pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. The percent of the reduction in the annual appropriation required by this chapter shall not exceed the percent of reduction in funding provided to K\u201312 schools and community colleges for the fiscal year below the funding level of minimum guarantee that would have been provided pursuant to Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution if the suspension of the operation of Proposition 98 had not occurred. (k) Nothing in this section prohibits the Legislature from appropriating funds for the program in excess of this minimum annual appropriation. 8821. For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply: (a) \u201CArts education program\u201D includes, but is not limited to, instruction and training, supplies, materials, and arts educational partnership programs, for instruction in: dance, media arts, music, theatre, and visual arts, including folk art, painting, sculpture, photography, and craft arts, creative expressions, including graphic arts and design, computer coding, animation, music composition and ensembles, and script writing, costume design, film, and video.

		"title": "IBM CP4BA Operators",
		"text": "The Cloud Pak for Business Automation operators capture the expert knowledge of administrators on how the system ought to behave, how to deploy it, and how to react if problems occur.The Cloud Pak for Business Automation operators are built from the Red Hat and Kubernetes Operator Framework, which is an open source toolkit that is designed to automate features such as updates, backups, and scaling. The operators handle upgrades and reacts to failures automatically.Operators help you to take care of repeatable tasks by using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tools. Operators \u201Cwatch\u201D over a Kubernetes environment and use its actual state versus the defined state to decide what actions to take. The following diagram shows the control loop that occurs as a result of constantly watching the state of the Kubernetes resources.\r\nThe following concepts are key to managing operators:Namespace deployment\r\nAt the beginning of a project, an administrator might encourage developers to use a short-lived namespace that is in their own name. These namespaces do not need to be metered. In the long term and for tracking purposes, it makes sense to divide up workloads into dedicated namespaces for your application lifecycle stages, such as development, preproduction, and production.\r\n\r\nIf you deploy all of your Cloud Pak for Business Automation capabilities at the same lifecycle stage into a targeted namespace, you can meter your deployments by the namespace and the platform label or swidtag. Metering uses a system of metadata annotation and aggregation, and is critical to help you understand your deployments against entitlements.\r\n\r\nRoles, role binding, and service accounts\r\nThe default for role-based access control (RBAC) is to deny all access unless you grant access.\r\n\r\nA role scopes a set of operations that can be carried out on a group of resources. A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a pod, so it is necessary to grant a role to a service account for intra-cluster processes. A role binding associates a service account to a role, which in effect determines the operations that the account can run inside a namespace. An administrator can configure the role and role binding resources for each application before any operator is deployed. Each application must specify a serviceAccountName in its pod spec, and the service account must be created.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram shows the relationship between the objects that are used to grant users access to Kubernetes API resources.\r\n\r\nThe Cloud Pak for Business Automation operators use a custom resource definition (CRD), which describes what the operator is meant to watch. The crd.yaml file contains the description of the custom resources for the container images, and the role.yaml and role_binding.yaml files define the access to the resources. The service_account.yaml file creates a service account with a role that has the permissions to manage the resources. The CRD specifies a configuration, but the cluster also needs controllers to monitor its state and reconcile the resource to match with the configuration. When the CRD is deployed it can then be used to control the automation containers by using Kubernetes primitives such as Services, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, and Secrets.\r\n\r\nTo control access, registry secrets and security context constraints (SCC) are needed to set the range of allowed IDs. A shared persistence volume (PV) is needed to store files such as JDBC drivers and other files that are used by the roles.\r\n\r\nThe operator lifecycle manager (OLM) acts as the management system for the operators on that cluster. Cluster administrators control which operators are available and who can interact with the running operators.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram shows the concepts that are involved and highlights the key components in controlling a deployed operator. To install the Cloud Pak capabilities, you use capability-specific custom resource (CR) templates that are on GitHub. You then create and customize your CR file, which you then apply to the Cloud Pak operator to watch.\r\n\r\nNote: In some cases, changes that you make in the custom resource YAML by using the operator or directly in the environment are not automatically propagated to all pods. For example, modifications to data source information or changes to Kubernetes secrets are not seen by running pods until the pods are restarted.\r\nIf changes applied by the operator or other modifications that are made in the environment do not provide the expected result, restart the pods by scaling the impacted deployments down to 0 then up to the desired number to have Kubernetes (OpenShift) terminate the existing pods and create new ones.",

		"title": "The Lord of the Rings: Concerning Hobbits",
		"text" : "\r\nThis book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history. Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. That story was derived from the earlier chap- ters of the Red Book, composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and called by him There and Back Again, since they told of his journey into the East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits in the great events of that Age that are here related.\r\nMany, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure is briefly recalled.\r\nHobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numer- ous formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of \u2018the Big Folk\u2019, as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.\r\nFor they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout and stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure.\r\n2 THE LORD OF THE RINGS\r\nThey seldom now reach three feet; but they have dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isumbras the Third, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.\r\nAs for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are con- cerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.\r\nIt is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great.\r\nThose days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the Hobbits in Bilbo\u2019s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from general\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE 3\r\namong them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.\r\nBefore the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger; and they preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.\r\nThe Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in Wilderland. They were the most normal and repre- sentative variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.\r\nThe Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again.\r\nThe Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even in Bilbo\u2019s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among\r\n\r\n4 THE LORD OF THE RINGS\r\nthe greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Du \u0301nedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they were dwin- dling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo\u2019s time; but one of the first to become important still endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that\r\nlay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.\r\nIt was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the Du \u0301nedain, who had in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of personal names out of\r\nthe past.\r\nAbout this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history\r\nwith a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at Fornost,* they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took all the land beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the king\u2019s messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.\r\nThus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, and all later dates were reckoned from it.\u2020 At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king they were in name his subjects,\r\n* As the records of Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, the twentieth of the Northern line, which came to an end with Arvedui three hundred years later.\r\n\u2020 Thus, the years of the Third Age in the reckoning of the Elves and the Du \u0301nedain may be found by adding 1600 to the dates of Shire-reckoning.\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE 5\r\nbut they were, in fact, ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it. Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158\u201360) were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.\r\nForty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.\r\nAt no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo\u2019s time that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather\u2019s tale. So, though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that sort.\r\n\r\n6 THE LORD OF THE RINGS\r\nNonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that aston- ished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.\r\nAll Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo\u2019s days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the well- to-do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even when they had holes to live in, Hobbits had long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.\r\nThe habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy- legged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire.\r\nIt is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from the Du \u0301nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE 7\r\nElves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the top of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west.\r\nThe craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls some- what bulged. That stage, however, belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.\r\nThe houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.,",

		"text" : "Zwei Häuser in Frontalansicht. Im Hoftor beugt sich eine Magd über eine Tonne. Sie hat geschrubbt, das Wasser im Rinnstein schimmert noch. Auf dem Gehweg spielen zwei Kinder. Eine Frau sitzt in der Türöffnung, erledigt Handarbeiten. Einen Augenblick nur und doch eine Ewigkeit dauert die Szenerie, eine Momentaufnahme aus dem bürgerlichen Delft des 17. Jahrhunderts. Festgehalten hat sie der neben Rembrandt (1606-1669) bekannteste Maler seiner Zeit, Jan Vermeer (1632-1675), der eigentlich Johannes Vermeer hieß. Meisterhaft hat er die unterschiedlichen Materialien auf die Leinwand gebracht: den rauen Backstein, die glatten, bleiverglasten Fenster, die hölzernen Fensterläden, das weiß verputzte Mauerstück. Alles wirkt echt, beinahe fotografiert: das Spiel von Hell und Dunkel, die Perspektiven, die heitere Ruhe. Die kleine Straße ist ein Meisterstück, so wie alle anderen Bilder Vermeers, die überliefert sind. Viele sind es nicht. Als er im Dezember des Jahres 1675 gerade mal 43-jährig stirbt, umfasst sein Œuvre 37 Gemälde. 28 sind jetzt im Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam zusammengekommen, acht mehr noch als vor 26 Jahren im Mauritshuis in Den Haag. Geliehen wurden die Kunstwerke aus den großen internationalen Museen, aus Privatsammlungen in Europa und den USA. Private Sponsoren griffen tief ins Portemonnaie. So entstand die bisher größte reine Vermeer-Schau - eine Sensation! Was die Vermeer-Fans anlockt, ist schwer zu beschreiben: Vermeers Umgang mit Pinsel und Farbe, sein technisches Geschick, das virtuose Spiel mit Lichteffekten, die Komposition, die Perspektivtreue. Vermeer war ein Meister des Lichtes, sagt Gregor Weber, Co-Kurator der Amsterdamer Schau. Kein Künstler hat das Licht so gemalt wie Vermeer, einerseits realistisch und doch voll rätselhafter Ruhe. Diana, die Göttin der Jagd, umringt von Gefährtinnen, eine wäscht Dianas Füße. Eine Szene aus der antiken Mythologie. Die Geschichte der keuschen Göttin war ein beliebtes Thema der holländischen Malerei. Auch der junge Vermeer idealisierte die Figuren. Italienische Einflüsse sind sichtbar. Und das, obwohl der Delfter Bürgersohn seine Heimatstadt nie verlassen hat. Mit 21 schrieb sich Vermeer in die Delfter Sankt Lukas-Gilde ein, als Meistermaler. Er griff zunächst historische Themen auf: Szenen aus der Bibel, aus der antiken Geschichte, Heiligenlegenden. Kühn wirkt sein Pinselstrich, der große Farbflächen schafft, dessen starke Hell-Dunkel-Kontraste an italienische Vorbilder erinnern, an Caravaggio (1571-1610) zum Beispiel. Noch rätselt die Wissenschaft, warum Vermeer ab 1656 sein Sujet änderte. Ein Bruch? Nein, ein Entwicklungssprung ist Vermeers Wechsel zu Genrebildern. Alltägliche Szenen rückte er nun ins Bild: eine Dienstmagd, wie sie Milch in einen Krug gießt. Ein junges Mädchen, briefschreibend; eine Tochter aus gutem Hause in der Musikstunde am Virginal, einer Art Mini-Cembalo. Allesamt Interieurs - mit Ausnahme jener zwei berühmten Stadtansichten, der Straße in Delft und der Ansicht von Delft. Es sind erdachte Interieurs und doch geben sie intime Einblicke in den Alltag des 17. Jahrhunderts. Die Zeit scheint stillzustehen. Die Bilder von Vermeer sind keine Erzählung in dem Sinne, dass dort viel passiert, dass dort herumgerannt wird, dass dort Pferde galoppieren oder etwas auf den Boden fällt und Leute sich prügeln oder so, sagt Vermeer-Experte Weber. Seine Bilder sind immer sehr still, sehr introvertiert. Vermeers Gemälde bergen ein Geheimnis. Es ist genau diese Stille, die das Publikum von heute so fasziniert. War es Pieter de Hooch (1629-1684), der Vermeer beeinflusste? Die Wissenschaft sucht noch nach Antworten. Vermeers Maltechnik verfeinerte sich mit den Jahren. Mit kleinen Farbtupfern schaffte er die Illusion von Licht, das auf der Oberfläche tanzt, die Dinge werden plastisch. Die Perle des Mädchens mit dem Perlenohrgehänge beispielsweise, ein Lichtreflex, nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger! Sein Pointillismus machte Vermeer berühmt. 1664 und 1665 malte er Interieurs, die stilistisch zueinander gehören: Immer ist es die junge Frau, mal mit Waage, mal mit Wasserkanne am Fenster, mit Perlenhalsband oder auch als Briefschreiberin in Gelb. Idealisierte Szenen aus dem täglichen Leben, jede für sich wohlkomponiert. Der Meister von Delft bediente sich nicht, wie bisher angenommen, der Camera obscura, der Lochkamera, um seine Perspektive zu finden. Ihm reichte ein Nagel, den er ins Holz stach, um mit dem Faden seine Perspektivlinien zu ziehen. Auch andere Maler nutzten diese Technik. Das kleine Loch im Fluchtpunkt: Restauratoren entdeckten es per Röntgenstrahl in vielen der untersuchten Vermeer-Gemälde.Damit nicht genug. Sie förderten auch ursprüngliche Absichten des Malers zutage: Eine Laute etwa auf dem Bild Junge Dame mit Perlenhalsband, einen nackten Jüngling auf dem Bild Brieflesendes Mädchen am offenen Fenster, den Vermeer oder ein Künstler nach ihm übermalte, weil dies als erotische Anspielung verstanden worden wäre.",
